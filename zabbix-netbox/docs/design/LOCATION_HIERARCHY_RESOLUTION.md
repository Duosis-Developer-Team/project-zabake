# NetBox Location Hierarchy Resolution (Zabbix sync)

## Purpose

Define how **NetBox DCIM location trees** map to Zabbix **host group / DC_ID** labels and how **location name filters** in device discovery include nested locations.

## Problem (fixed)

Previously, `get_location_name` only looked at the **immediate parent** once. For a chain `DC18 → DH3 → Rack-A1`, a device assigned to `Rack-A1` resolved to **`DH3`** instead of the root **`DC18`**.

The location filter in `fetch_all_devices` only loaded **direct children** of the selected location, so deeper descendants were excluded from the filter set.

## Current behavior

### 1. Root location name (`resolve_root_location_name` / `get_location_name`)

- Start from the device’s assigned `location` (id or expanded object).
- `GET /api/dcim/locations/{id}/` and read `parent`.
- If `parent` is `null`, the current location is the **root**; return its `name`.
- Otherwise follow `parent` (dict with `id` or bare id) and repeat.
- Guards: cycle detection (`visited`), max depth (32), then fallbacks to leaf name or `site.name`.

**Implementation:**

- Ansible: embedded Python in [`playbooks/roles/netbox_zabbix_sync/tasks/process_device.yml`](../../playbooks/roles/netbox_zabbix_sync/tasks/process_device.yml)
- Reference + tests: [`scripts/netbox_location_hierarchy.py`](../../scripts/netbox_location_hierarchy.py)

### 2. Location filter subtree (BFS + pagination)

When a run uses `location_filter` (by name), the playbook resolves the matching location id, then collects **all descendant** location ids:

- Breadth-first search over `GET /api/dcim/locations/?parent_id={id}&limit=1000`
- Follow `next` until no page remains for each parent.

Device fetch then uses one `location_id` at API level or filters in Python when multiple ids apply (unchanged).

**Implementation:**

- [`playbooks/roles/netbox_zabbix_sync/tasks/fetch_all_devices.yml`](../../playbooks/roles/netbox_zabbix_sync/tasks/fetch_all_devices.yml)
- Same algorithm in [`scripts/netbox_location_hierarchy.py`](../../scripts/netbox_location_hierarchy.py) (`bfs_collect_descendant_location_ids`)

- [`mappings/host_groups_config.yml`](../../mappings/host_groups_config.yml) — `get_location_name` for computed host groups
- [`mappings/tags_config.yml`](../../mappings/tags_config.yml) — `Location` tag uses root name; `Location_Detail` remains the device’s own location name
